# RiskAnalyzer
AR/VR project that, thanks to image recognition by AI, allows analyzing the risks present in the user's field of vision.

This project is a demo of the prototype created during the 2024 edition of the student Hackathon organized by MIC (Meet Innovate Create).

This application is designed to assist visually impaired individuals in identifying risks around them using Text-to-Speech and the future collaboration between Meta and Ray-Ban.

The application could also be applied in B2B scenarios for security systems that would alert the police if a suspicious person is detected or notify firefighters if a fire breaks out in a house.
